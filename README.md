# CiTIUS Invaders

An old-style arcade game to learn evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming. [Play here!](https://citiususc.github.io/citius-invaders/)

## How to play

Controls are very easy. Just use left/right arrow to move your robot and space to shot. The goal is to keep the number of invaders below 100, otherwise the game is over. There are always at least 4 invaders, which are protected with blue shields.
